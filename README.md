# brain_tumor_segmentation
This project uses deep learning to detect brain tumors from MRI images.  The model takes an MRI image as input and predicts a mask that shows the tumor area. It learns to separate tumor pixels from normal brain tissue.  The goal is to help automatically identify tumor regions using image segmentation.
